Acting was good and photography was good to but not that much on story .little sloppy on screenplay . Except for the first song rest of them were really misplaced . Even if they removed the songs wouldn't bad. Hrithik was good and did hold up his own , but might not be right role for him. Rest of cast did good and were apt . Villan was good looking but man had a single line dialogue. Should have more . One time watch that too if you hardcore fan of Hrithik ."

The story has been told in such a heartwarming way that the audience is totally involved in this inspiring story of grit, determination and victory against all odds. The performances are award worthy. Vikram Massey is outstanding in the lead role and is well supported by the rest of the cast. The direction, screenplay and editing are top notch. Unfortunately in India the over the top and illogical films become blockbusters and the really outstanding films don't do well commercially. I hope the Indian audience views such films as it will encourage film makers to do top quality work of international standards."

The first half of the film struggles with pacing, but the second half gains momentum, leading to an intense and emotionally charged climax. The confrontation between Sambhaji Maharaj and Aurangzeb, particularly the exchange between Vicky Kaushal and Vineet Kumar, stands out as one of the film's most powerful moments. The battle sequences are well-executed, but the background score by A. R. Rahman lacks the necessary intensity to match the spirit of the Marathas. The action scenes are largely effective, though some exaggerated stunts and editing choices take away from the realism. Despite this, the film excels in its cinematography, costume design, and CGI, successfully recreating the historical setting."

The way the narrative builds up to these events ensures that they hit with full force, leaving the audience emotionally devastated yet filled with admiration for the unwavering courage of Sambhaji Maharaj.

For those who like action and violence will definitely enjoy the film but for people who are intrested in the story may not enjoy it much. But still visuals and technically it is very good. Even the action choreography was nice with utmost realism like not putting finger on the trigger all the time handling gun professional and ofcourse in some parts of action movie team took cinematic liberty like chopping of thighs in one swing which is impossible for humans as thighs are one of the hardest bones in human body. And the long take during action was awesome it gave a vibe of extraction. When nani's body is shown in the end with all the muscles you will be convinced that this person can really kill as many people as he did on the screen. Cameo's gave high at the end of the movie."

The hero's dialogue even tried too hard to capture Dhanush's style, coming off as awkward and a bit irritating. The first half was sluggish, and the second half dragged even more. I had high expectations, especially watching it on opening day with a lively crowd, but it just didn't deliver the experience I hoped for.

I couldn't help myself, but to shed tears of both spectrum of human emotions at several instances. Masterclass filmmaking which made us forget that we are sitting in our seats and rather, witnessing the tale on live. Shiva's and Pallavi's role was simply the reflections of Mukund and Indhu. Thanks to the maker Rajkumar Periyaswamy and the producers for choosing and making an incident which instills on all of us about the hardships and the bravery of our Indian Army. JAI HIND!"

But my god what a emotional roller coaster this was. Such a awesome performance by Sivakarthikeyen and Sai Pallavi. I feel a bit in shock about life and death after watching this movie thinking about soldiers personal life and sacrifices they fave in the battlefield and during war. This has been one awesome depiction and tribute to what happen 10 years ago to Major Mukund V. And leading to that period, about of love and sacrifice about life and death... Those we leave behind. Such a emotional family drama war movie. Lo",

                text: "Rana daggubati as rana does putforth a formidable performance. Mostly stoic at unemotionally challenging sequences but really tugging at your heart strings when his dark childhood comes under light. You get to see the rana emotionally active then. Venkatesh daggubati, with his heavy hyderabadi accent, plays a deceitful character. Abhishek banerjee as jaffa and sushant singh as tej put enough life into their characters to engage audiences. Surveen chawla is the only strong female presence in the show, and she is a force to reckon with. Among the men, she does command respect. Gaurav chopra, for most part of the show, gives a loud and hammy performance.",

It's honestly a show that get's better each time you view it. It's cathartic to see Walter break bad and how the story unravels is the best way it could have. Very good storytelling, well done to Vince Gilligan."

I know that people say that about a ton of different shows but Breaking Bad really is universally thought of as one of the greatest shows of all-time. All you have to do is go google 'greatest tv shows of all-time' and I guarantee you that it's at or near the top of every list you'll find and there's a reason for that...because it is! Every season is just as brilliant as the others, which everyone knows is almost impossible for a show to do but one which Breaking Bad absolutely pulls off!! If you're one of the few people who still haven't seen this amazing show then do yourself a favor and go watch this immediately...you will not be disappointed!",
